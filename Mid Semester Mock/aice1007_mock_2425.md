This is the mock paper for the AICE1007 mid-semester test. This is a markdown
file (https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). The "real"
assessment will be typeset into a traditional examination booklet, which
contains the following preamble, and its own set of ten question-parts.

# Preamble

This question contains C99 snippets. Terminology:

 - Where appropriate, assume all C99 is compiled with the GCC 14.2.0 compile
   driver, with the following flags:
    - Wall
    - Wextra
    - Werror
    - Wvla
    - pedantic
    - std=c99
   For reference, this is the same list as recommended for use in the
   laboratories in this module.

 - When a question states that a C99 program is built, this includes
   preprocessing, compilation, and linking into an executable. A program cannot
   be built if any of these stages errors.

 - When a question states that a C99 snippet is compiled, this specifically
   refers to the creation of an object file from the translation unit, and does
   not include linking.

 - When a question asks for the return value of a C99 program, this refers to
   the output of `main`.

 - Assume all building, execution, and questions on size occur on a Big-Endian
   byte-ordered POSIX machine with the following sizes:
   - sizeof(char): 1
   - sizeof(short): 2
   - sizeof(int): 4
   - sizeof(float): 4
   - sizeof(long): 8
   - sizeof(double): 8
   - sizeof(void*): 8
   - sizeof(long double): 16

This question contains 10 parts. Each part is worth 3 marks.

# Parts

## Q1

Consider the following C99 program:

```
struct mystruct{int data;};
static struct mystruct s;
void alter(void){__A__}
int main(void){alter(); return s.data;}
```

State what `__A__` must be replaced with to cause the program to return the
value 9.

## Q2

State the return value of the following C99 program. Partial marks available
for incorrect answers with appropriate working.

```
int main(void)
{
    char a = 0xB;
    char *b = &a;
    (*b)++;
    a *= *b;
    return a;
}
```

## Q3

State the return value of the following C99 program.

```
static int y = 1;

int up_up_and_away(void)
{
    static int x = 0;
    x += y;
    return x;
}

int main(void)
{
    up_up_and_away();
    up_up_and_away();
    up_up_and_away();
    y++;
    return up_up_and_away();
}
```

## Q4

Consider the following incomplete C99 program:

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    FILE *f = fopen("myfile.txt", "w");
    fprintf(f, "Hello ");
    fclose(f);
    f = fopen("myfile.txt", __A__);
    fprintf(f, __B__);
    fclose(f);
    return 0;
}
```

State what `__A__` and `__B__` must be replaced with in order for the file at
"myfile.txt" to contain "Hello world!" with a newline at the end, after this
program has been executed. Assume that `fopen`, `fprintf`, and `fclose` do not
error given appropriate input.

## Q5

Consider the following imcomplete C99 program:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(void)
{
    char *p1 = malloc(10 * sizeof(char));
    p1[9] = 'F';
    char *p2 = realloc(p1, 20);
    printf("%c\n", __A__);
    free(__B__);
    return 0;
}
```

State what `__A__` must be replaced with to print element 9 of the
dynamically-allocated character array (here set to value 'F').

Also state what `__B__` must be replaced with to free the allocated memory.

Assume that `malloc` and `realloc` do not error.

## Q6

Consider the following incomplete C99 program:

```
int main(void)
{
    __A__
    {
        int d;
        float f;
    } x;
    x.d = sizeof(x);
    x.f = x.d * 2;
    return x.f;
}
```

State the return value of the program in the case when `__A__` is a `union`,
and in the case when `__A__` is a `struct`.

## Q7

Consider the following incomplete C99 program split into three files:

main.c:

```
#include "b.h"
int main(void)
{
    int x;
    clear_data(&x);
    set_data(&x, 5);
    return x;
}
```

b.c:

```
#include "b.h"
void clear_data(int *d){set_data(d, 0);}
```

b.h:

```
void set_data(int *d, int value){*d = value;}
void clear_data(int *d);
```

The two source files main.c and b.c compile, but fail during linking with the
following message from the linker:

```
ld: /tmp/ccdXW0VN.o: in function `set_data':
b.h:1: multiple definition of `set_data'; b.h:1: first defined here
```

Without changing `main.c`, explain how this program may be repaired such that
it returns 5.

## Q8

Consider the following C99 program:

```
typedef struct bits{unsigned a : __A__;} field;
int main(void)
{
    field s = {0xf};
    s.a++;
    return s.a;
}
```

State what `__A__` must be replaced with for this program to return 0.

## Q9

Consider the following C99 program:

```
struct data
{
    int out;
    __A__
};

int main(void)
{
    struct data d = {0, &d};
    return d.n->n->n->n->n->n->n->n->n->n->n->n->n->n->n->n->n->n->out;
}
```

State the single field that `__A__` must be replaced with for this program to
return 0.

## Q10

Consider the following C99 program:

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    char *c, macbeth[] =
        "Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.";
    c = macbeth;
    do
    {
        if (*c == ' ') *c = '_';
        else if (*c == '_') *c = ' ';  /* ? */
        c++;
    } while (*c);
    printf("%s", macbeth);
    return 0;
}
```

State every character this program prints to stdout.

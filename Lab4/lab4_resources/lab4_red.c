/* This is a C99 Fibonacci number generator with a subtle bug in it. Your
 * objective is to fix this implementation by finding the bug, and repairing
 * the source file.
 *
 * To pass this exercise, submit the fixed source file to the submission system
 * to have it checked. To pass, make as few modifications to this source file
 * as possible.
 *
 * The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical sequence governed by the rule
 * $x_{n+1}=x_n+x_{n-1}$, where x_0=0 and x_1=1.
 * (https://quicklatex.com/cache3/68/ql_783ae9ec1e3597a6c5e1fdd85d5c8668_l3.png),
 * where n is always an unsigned integer. By way of example, the tenth (n=9)
 * fibonacci number is 34.
 *
 * The function below should return the nth fibonacci number, but it does not. */
